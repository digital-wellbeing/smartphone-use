# Data processing Study 1

Let's process the raw data and get them to a format that we can work with for the analysis.
Study 1 has three raw data files:

* `diary_raw.csv` is the end of day survey participants filled out during the diary part of the study
* `screen_time_raw.csv` is the objective screen time data participants reported
* `personality_raw.csv` is the survey participants filled out at the beginning of the study, reporting personality traits

## Diary data

Let's load and inspect the diary data.
